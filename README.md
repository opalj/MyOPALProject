A small template project to get started using the [OPAL Java bytecode framework](http://www.opal-project.de). 

### How do I get set up? ###

To develop your own OPAL based solution, fork this repository, install `sbt`. After that, go to the main folder and call `sbt run`. This will return the list of all public methods (including those defined by the compiled build script).
